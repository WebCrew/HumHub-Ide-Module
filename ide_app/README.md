CODEIT is an Online Code Editor or simple IDE for Javascript, HTML, PHP , CSS and XML (soon also for LESS, MD and JSON)
CODEIT allows you to develop HTML5 applications directly online.

Thanks to the Codemirror library developed by Marijn Haverbeke (codemirror.net)
we have created an IDE online with everything you need for the development.  

REQUIREMENTS

CODEIT is compatible with browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera.
Some features such as upload files via "drag and drop" from your computer to CODEIT File Browser, are only available for Chrome. For all other browsers You can use the default file upload.
The server portion of CODEIT was built with PHP 5.3.0. 

INSTALLATION

If you have a web site hosted on linux or windows platform with PHP 5.3.0 you already have everything you need.
After downloading Upload all files and folders via Ftp into a folder of your web space.

The default root path folder "Projects Root" is "../Projects_Root" ( remember to set the write permission to save your files into )

Open the "yourRemoteFolder/CODEIT/config.php" file and read the instructions on how to create your username, your password and eventually your custom root path folder.

At that point open the index file: "yourRemoteFolder/CODEIT/index_EN.php" with the browser.
Enter your username and your password into the form.
If everything is correctly configured, you should see all your files within our "virtual hard drive" (Projects_Root) inside your root path folder. 


Kind regards,
